# File Organizer Script
## Description
The `FileOrganizer.py` script is a simple utility for organizing files in a specified directory. It automatically sorts files into subdirectories based on their file extensions, making it easier to manage and locate files.
## Features
- *Automatic Organization:* Files are moved into subfolders named after their extensions (e.g., all `.jpg` files go into a folder named `jpg`).
- *Dynamic Folder Creation:* If a folder for a specific file type doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

2. Download the FileOrganizer.py script.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script using the following command:
python FileOrganizer.py
5. When prompted, enter the path of the directory you want to organize.
Enter path: /path/to/your/directory
6. The script will process the files in the specified directory and create folders for each file type, moving the corresponding files into their respective folders.
