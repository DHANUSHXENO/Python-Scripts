# Sorting Algorithms
======================

This folder contains implementations of three common sorting algorithms in Python: Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, and Selection Sort. Additionally, there are explanation scripts that print out the steps involved in each sorting process.

## Algorithms
------------

### Insertion Sort

* Implementation: `insertionsort.py`
* Explanation: `insertionsort-explanation.py`

### Bubble Sort

* Implementation: `bubblesort.py`
* Explanation: `bubblesort-explanation.py`

### Selection Sort

* Implementation: `selectionsort.py`
* Explanation: `selectionsort-explanation.py`

## Usage
-----

To run the implementations, simply execute the corresponding Python script. For example, to run the Insertion Sort implementation, run `python insertionsort.py`.

To see the step-by-step explanation of each sorting process, run the corresponding explanation script. For example, to see the explanation of Insertion Sort, run `python insertionsort-explanation.py`.
