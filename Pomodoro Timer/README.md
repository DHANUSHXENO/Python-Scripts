# Pomodoro Timer
## ðŸ“‹ Overview
The Pomodoro Timer is a productivity tool designed to help you manage your time efficiently using the Pomodoro Technique. It splits your work into intervalsâ€”typically 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break. This cycle helps to boost focus and prevent burnout by encouraging regular breaks. The script is cross-platform, supporting both Windows and macOS/Linux.

## âœ¨ Features
- **Customizable Work and Break Durations:** Set your preferred time for work and break sessions.
- **Support for Multiple Cycles:** Run multiple Pomodoro sessions in a row.
- **Platform-Specific Alerts:**
- **Windows:** Uses sound alerts (winsound) to notify users when a session is complete.
- **macOS/Linux:** Uses terminal beep commands for notifications.
