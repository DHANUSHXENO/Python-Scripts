# Road Lane Detection

This project is a Python program that uses OpenCV to detect lanes on roads. Unlike other lane detection programs, this one dynamically calculates the mask based on the color of the road, making it more adaptable to different environments.

## Features

- **Dynamic Mask Calculation**: Adjusts the mask according to the road color.
- **Lane Detection**: Identifies and highlights lanes on the road.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

## Acknowledgements

- OpenCV documentation
- Various online tutorials and resources
